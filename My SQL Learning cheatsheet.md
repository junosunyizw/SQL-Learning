## üíΩTypes of Data

- integer or INT - whole numbers
- numeric - number with decimal
- varchar(x) - 'x' maxmium of character,normal is 50 or 200
- char(x) - 'x' fix length of character strings
- text - any length of character strings
- boolean - True = 1, False = 0 or NULL
- date - date
- time - datetime
- timestamps - timezone

### CAST Statement

```
CAST(expression AS data_type);

```
### CONVERT Statement


### FORMAT Statement


## üí°TIPS

### *OR & AND Operators*

When there are multiple conditions related to OR and AND Operators, Must use **()** for OR operator for serparating the conditions. Otherwise, Results may be different.


### CTE

Comparing Subquery, Temp table and Views, CTE is more performace and efficiency to process query.
However, when creating 2rd CTE in the same query, you cannot process query of 2rd CTE, which is related 1st CTE.

```
Example:

with 
t1
    as
    (
    select s.name reps_name, r.name reg_name, sum(total_amt_usd) total_sales
    from accounts a
    JOIN orders o
    on a.id=o.account_id
    JOIN sales_reps s
    on s.id=a.sales_rep_id
    JOIN region r
    on r.id=s.region_id
    GROUP BY 1,2
    order by 3 desc
    ),
t2 as
    (select reg_name, max(total_sales) total_sales
    from t1
    GROUP BY 1) -- error to process the query in t2 only as t1 is not existed in t2 table
select t1.reps_name, t1.reg_name,t1.total_sales
from t1
JOIN t2
on t1.reg_name=t2.reg_name AND t1.total_sales=t2.total_sales

```


## ‚ùåERRORS IN SQL & HOW TO FIX THEM

### *Division by Zero Error*
- Method 1: Use the NULLIF Function
```
SELECT numerator / NULLIF(denominator, 0)
FROM my_table;
```
- Method 2: Use a CASE Statement
```
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN denominator = 0 THEN NULL
    ELSE numerator / denominator
  END
FROM my_table;
```
- Method 3: Use a TRY/CATCH Block (using PostgreSQL 10 or later)
```
BEGIN
  SELECT numerator / denominator
  FROM my_table;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN division_by_zero THEN
    -- Handle the error here
END;
```
