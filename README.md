## SQL Learning

Hello, and welcome to my SQL learning repository.

**Background:**

I come from an accounting background and have worked in e-commerce retail corporations for 8 years. As e-commerce has grown, there has the amount of data that I have to work with. This data is often stored in multiple sources, making it difficult to access and provide comprehensive reporting and analysis to management. I found it time-consuming to retrieve useful data from different sources using old methods. As a result, I realized that I needed to upgrade my knowledge to be more effective and efficient in fetching data from sources. SQL is the primary language to help me achieve my goal, and I believe that nobody needs an explanation of its importance.

**Reasons for Creating this Repo:**

1. During my SQL learning journey, I have joined multiple free and paid classes on different websites with many resources. I want to outline what I have learned from these websites and also allow users of this repository to compare which class is most suitable for them to learn at their own pace.
2. I will track the courses and solutions that I come across which will be useful for my study and job.

**Related Databases being Hosted in Different Servers on Learning:**
