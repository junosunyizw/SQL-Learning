## Introduction:
In this project, I am learning SQL using MySQL instead of MS SQL, which was used in the original course by Alex The Analyst. This is because I often study in a cafe that only allows shopping center wifi, which is not secure enough to connect to cloud databases. Therefore, I installed a local MySQL server on my Mac. This experience taught me two important things for SQL learning.
- Deploying a local database server is helpful when working with SQL
- Important to be aware of differences in syntax when learning from different SQL servers
